1. 海外留学以外の例を挙げて、日本人の内向性を40語程度で説明
主張: 日本人の若者の内向性の例の1つは、友達や家族とでない限りほとんど話をしないことである。
具体: 実際、彼らは道ですれ違った人と挨拶をしないし、彼らは近所の人と話すことも少ない。

One example of Japanese youth's introversion is that they rarely converse with others unlike with their family members or friends. In fact, most of them do not greet strangers and they rarely talk with neighborhoods.

2.内向的だから留学しないという理由に賛成か？他の理由があるか？
主張: 反対
理由: 金銭的な理由が最も大きいと考えるから
具体: ほとんどの大学生は奨学金を借り、アルバイトをして大学に通っていて、留学に行く余裕がない

I disagree with the reason mentioned in the passage, because I think the biggest cause is the financial problem.
Many Japanese university students use student loan and work part-time to return this as soon as possible, so they cannnot afford to study abroad.
Therefore, Japanese students seldom study abroad because of the financial problem rather than their introversion.
