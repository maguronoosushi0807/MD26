Most Japanese high school students have to choose their course of study either from humanities("bunkei") or science("rikei") in the middle of their high school education. One of the reasons is to help students prepare for university entrance examinations and reduce their burden of subjects studied.
At the same time, this narrows the range of choices for their future careers at a very early stage. Write your opinion on this current practice in a well-organized paragraph. It should be approximately 100 English words long, including specific reasons to support your argument.

主張: 文理選択を高校の中盤というとても早い段階ですることに反対 
具体1: 決めるのが早すぎるから。多くの生徒は将来なにがしたいか決まりきっていない。また、専門的な知識がないまま選ぶことになるからミスマッチが起こりやすい
具体2: そもそも入試の負担を軽くするには試験の難易度を下げたり、理科や社会などの科目を減らせば良い
結論: 決めるには早すぎる、また試験の負荷を減らすには別の方法があるから、早い段階で決めさせるべきではない

I disagree with the practice that choosing course of study either from humanities or science in the middle of their high school education.
One reason is that it is too early to choose their course. Many high school students do not realize what they really want to do in the future. Also, most high school students hardly have special knowledge of engineering or medicine and so on,  and this could make mismatch.
Another is that there is other way to reduce burden of studying for university entrance exams. For example, eliminating social study and science from test, or making students solve easy problems can reduce burden, instead of narrowing their future.

Therefore, students should not be required to choose their course sucha an early stage, since there are better ways to reduce burden.

Therefore, high school students should not be made to choose course because it is too early and not a best way to reduce burden.
