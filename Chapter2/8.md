すべての大学生にボランティア活動を義務付けるべきであるという意見に賛成ですか、反対ですか。

主張: 義務付けるべきではない(反対)
理由: どれだけボランティアが良いことであっても、誰でもボランティアができるとは限らないから
具体例1: 学費のためにアルバイトをしなければならない学生は、ボランティアを強制されると経済的に困る
具体例2: 研究に忙しくてボランティアに時間を割けない学生もいる

I disagree with the opinion that all college students are required to participate in volunteer activities because no matter how good volunteer activities are, not all people can volunteer.
Some students who work part-time for educational expenses, and they would have financial problems if they were obliged to participate in volunteer activities.
Other students are busy with their studies.

Since a mandatory system would place an unfair burden on certain students, it should not be introduced.
