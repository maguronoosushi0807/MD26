すべての大学生にボランティア活動を義務付けるべきであるという意見に賛成ですか、反対ですか。

背景: ボランティアの参加者数が少ないから出題された？

主張: 義務付けるべきである(賛成)
理由: ボランティアは、めんどくさくてメリットのないことだと思っている人が多く、それがやらない理由となっているから。
結論: スーパーに試食があるように、一度ボランティアを経験すると次もボランティアをやりやすくなり、結果としてボランティアの人数が増える。


I agree with the opinion that all college students are obliged to do volunteer activities.
It is because many people think that they are hassle and they do not have any merit, and these reasons lead not to participate in volunteer activities.
If college students experienced a volunteer activity once, they are likely to participate in another in the future, so as a result, many people would do volunteer activities.
